## Hi there üëã and Welcome to DataBytes üòÅ

Welcome to the DataBytes organization on GitHub! We're excited to have you here contributing to our various repositories. To ensure smooth collaboration and maintain a high quality of code, we have established some guidelines and best practices that we expect all members to follow.

Our mission is leveraging the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Digital Finance.

**This trimester we are running 4 projects:**
- Project Echo (led by ANDREW KUDILCZAK & STEPHAN KOKKAS)
- DiscountMate (led by HIMANSHU)
- FinTech (led by SAMANTHA PETRI)
- DataBytes Company Website (a last minute addition, led by HOPI BEE)



## Rules

- **_Locking main branch_**: The main branch is the production-ready branch of our repositories. As such, it is to be locked to prevent accidental pushes and merges. If you need to make changes to the main branch, create a pull request. *Navigate to the repository settings, and under the "Branches" tab, enable "Require pull request reviews before merging" and "Require status checks to pass before merging". This will prevent anyone from pushing directly to the main branch and ensure that changes are made via pull requests.*

- **_Creating pull and merge requests:_** Any changes to our repositories must be made via a pull request. This includes code changes, documentation updates, and adding or removing files. The pull request should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged. *To create a pull request, navigate to the repository on GitHub, click on the "Pull requests" tab, and then click the "New pull request" button. Fill out the necessary information, including the branch you're merging from and the branch you're merging into. Make sure to assign at least one other team member as a reviewer.*

- **_Code review by at least 1 team member before merging:_** To ensure the quality of code, every pull request must be reviewed by at least one other team member. This ensures that code is readable, maintainable, and free of bugs before it is merged. *When a pull request is submitted, assign at least one team member as a reviewer. This person will be responsible for reviewing the code changes and either approving or requesting changes before the pull request can be merged.*

- **_Creating branches:_** When working on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch. This branch should have a descriptive name that explains what it does. Once the work is complete, create a pull request to merge the branch into the main branch. *When creating a branch, make sure to give it a descriptive name that explains what it does. To create a branch, navigate to the repository on GitHub, click on the "Branches" tab, and then click the "New branch" button. Give the branch a name and make sure to create it off of the main branch.*

- **_Limiting the number of admins per repo:_** To ensure that access to our repositories is limited to those who truly need it, we limit the number of admins per repo. If you need admin access to a repo, please speak to the repo owner. *To limit the number of admins per repo, navigate to the repository settings, click on the "Manage access" tab, and then add team members as needed. Make sure to only give admin access to those who truly need it.*

**Best Practices**

- **_Commit frequently:_** Committing frequently helps track changes and makes it easier to revert changes if needed.
Write clear commit messages:_** Commit messages should be clear and descriptive. They should explain what the commit does and why it was made.
- **_Use branches:_** Creating branches helps keep the main branch clean and makes it easier to manage changes.
- **_Use issues:_** Issues are a great way to keep track of bugs and feature requests. Use them to organize work and track progress.
- **_Keep documentation up-to-date:_** Documentation should be updated whenever code changes are made. This helps keep the codebase readable and maintainable.
- **_Be responsive:_** Respond to pull requests and issues in a timely manner. This helps keep the project moving forward and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

*Note: If you are unsure how to enforce the above rules, please reach out to Stephan Kokkas (skokkas@deakin.edu.au) or through Teams :)*

Thank you for contributing to DataBytes! Let's build some great things together.
